## React Egghead

JSX is not an entirely different language, but it is a bit of an extension to the language, so knowing how you would express certain JavaScript things within the JSX syntax is important to using JSX effectively. In this lesson we’ll explore a few different things you can do with JSX, like interpolation, composition, and spreading props. And we’ll compare these syntaxes with what is generated by babel so we have a good understanding of how this translates to regular JavaScript calls into React.createElement.
